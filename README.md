# Eliza-Chatbot
This project implements an ELIZA chatbot in Python, simulating a conversation with a psychotherapist. Using regular expressions for word spotting and sentence transformations, the chatbot responds to user inputs by converting statements into questions, mimicking a Rogerian psychotherapist.
